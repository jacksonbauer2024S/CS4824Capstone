## Overview
This project applies machine learning to model and predict the spread of the *Spotted Lanternfly across the United States.  
Using citizen science data from EDDMapS, environmental features, and spatial lag features, the models attempts to identify the counties most at risk to infestation.


## Research Questions
1. How has the spotted lanternfly population grown and spread across the U.S. since 2014?  
2. What spatial and temporal patterns emerge from the occurrence data?  
3. Can we use machine learning models to predict the next infestation?


## Methods and Models
- **Baseline Model:** Logistic Regression using  coordinates  
- **Environmental Model:** Uses tree presence and urbanization features with no location features
- **Spatial Model:** Adds a spatial lag feature to capture neighborhood effects  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score


## Instructions 

Jupyter Notebooks can be found in the Notebooks directory.
Notebooks should be ran in this order:
1. data_cleaning.ipynb
